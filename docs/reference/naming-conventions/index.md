# Naming Conventions

A naming convention is a convention for naming things.
A good naming convention is scalable, unique, and easy to understand.

In the context of infrastructure, the purpose of naming conventions is to name infrastructure resources with a unique and meaningful name.
This makes it easier to understand the purpose of a resource and to identify the resource in a list of resources.
